USB crypto token based on cheap Atmel's AVR AtMega8 using strong ECC public/private key cryptography...

===Features===
  * On-token private key operations (ECDSA Sign) with acceptable speed (~2seconds/sign for prime192v1 NIST curve)
  * chip hardware (few $) - all crypto operations and USB support even done in software 
  * easy uC programming (initial uC programming via Atmel's SPI interface, further firmware updates via USB)
  * working openct driver, opensc ECC patch, firefox pkcs11 support (via opensc pkcs11 plugin) - client certificate login tested

===TODO===

  * better hardware RNG (needed for ECDSA Sign and onboard key generation) - I have primitive one (single capacitor :), but i think it shoud be better.
  * onboard private key generation
  * PIN support
  * better pkcs11/15 compilance
  * multiple key/certificate support
  * a lot of testing and bug hunting
  * more application support (mail signing in thunderbird, kerberos PKINIT support etc)
